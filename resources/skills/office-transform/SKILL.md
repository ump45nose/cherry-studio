description: Derive new Office files from structural selections without touching the original. Use when the user points at part of a spreadsheet, Word document, PDF, or PowerPoint deck (a worksheet range, paragraph, page, slide, shape, or a pasted selection-ref block) and wants it extracted, converted, or edited — the result is always a NEW file; the source file is never modified. Covers xlsx range extraction to csv/markdown/xlsx, docx paragraph extraction and text replacement, pdf page extraction, pptx slide/shape/table-cell extraction and editing, and targeted xlsx cell edits.

# Office Transform

Turn a structural selection of an Office/PDF document into a new derived file.

Two invariants hold for every operation:

1. **The source file is read-only.** Every result is a new file; both scripts refuse to
   write to the source path or overwrite an existing file. Never work around this with
   ad-hoc shell edits to the original.
2. **Anchors are structural.** Selections address the document's own coordinates —
   worksheet + A1 range, body-level paragraph ordinal, one-based page number — never
   screen or DOM positions.

## When to use which tool

- Only need to *read* a document to summarize or answer questions → use
  `mcp__cherry-tools__to_markdown` instead (see the cherry-tool-guide skill); it is
  lossy but built for reading.
- The user wants a *file* out — an extracted range, a converted fragment, an edited
  copy → this skill.

## Input: selection references

Chat surfaces may hand you a fenced `selection-ref` block:

```selection-ref
{"path": "/abs/report.xlsx", "anchor": {"format": "xlsx", "sheet": "Sheet1", "range": "A1:C10"}, "excerpt": "…", "fileStamp": {"size": 1024, "mtimeMs": 1700000000000}}
```

The `anchor` object is exactly what the scripts take via `--anchor`.

**Freshness check.** `fileStamp.mtimeMs` is milliseconds since the Unix epoch, floored to
whole milliseconds. Do not compare it to `stat`'s default output: `stat -f %m` (macOS) and
`stat -c %Y` (GNU) give whole *seconds*, so multiplying by 1000 loses the sub-second part and
never matches. Read it the same way the app wrote it, and allow one second of slack so a
filesystem with coarser timestamps does not report every file as changed:

```bash
uv run python -c "import os,sys;st=os.stat(sys.argv[1]);print(st.st_size, int(st.st_mtime*1000))" '/abs/report.xlsx'
```

Treat the file as changed when the size differs, or when the mtimes differ by more than
1000 ms. On a change, tell the user the file changed since they selected and ask them to
re-select — never silently re-anchor.

**Anchor check.** Before a patch-copy edit, also verify the anchor still points where the
user thinks: extract the anchored region first and compare its text with the reference's
`excerpt`; on a mismatch, stop and tell the user the anchor no longer matches their
selection — never edit at a mismatched anchor and never go searching for a "close enough"
location. Compare after normalizing both sides the same way (NFC, collapse each whitespace
run to one space, trim). Two cases need care because the two sides are not directly
comparable as-is:

- **xlsx**: the `excerpt` is tab-separated cells and newline-separated rows, while extraction
  writes csv or md. Compare cell values, not the raw file — read the csv with a csv reader and
  join the fields with single spaces before normalizing, so `,` and `|` never count as a
  difference.
- **docx with `charRange`**: extraction returns only that slice, but patch-copy compares (and
  replaces) the **whole paragraph**. Re-extract the paragraph *without* `charRange` for this
  check, and see "Edit docx" below before writing. Users may also describe
the region in words ("sheet 2, columns A through C"); build the anchor JSON yourself,
confirming the worksheet name or paragraph if ambiguous.

Anchor shapes:

| Format | Anchor |
| --- | --- |
| xlsx | `{"format":"xlsx","sheet":"Sheet1","range":"A1:C10"}` (range may be one cell) |
| docx | `{"format":"docx","paragraph":3,"paraId":"502E8D33","charRange":[0,12]}` (`paraId` optional = the paragraph's `w14:paraId`, resolved first when present; `charRange` optional; ordinal counts body-level paragraphs only, tables excluded) |
| pdf | `{"format":"pdf","page":3,"charRange":[0,120]}` (`charRange` optional, applies to extracted text) |
| pptx | `{"format":"pptx","slide":2,"nodeId":"4","paragraph":0,"tableCell":{"row":1,"col":0}}` (`slide` is one-based; `nodeId` is the OOXML shape id — omit for the whole slide; `paragraph` and `tableCell` are optional, mutually exclusive, and only valid together with `nodeId`) |

## Operations

Scripts live in this skill's `scripts/` directory; resolve paths relative to this
skill folder. Python dependencies are per-format and provided at invocation time via
`uv run --with <pkg>` (the bundled-shell idiom — do not `pip install` globally).

### Extract — pull the anchored region into a new file

Always single-quote paths — real documents have spaces in their names (`Q1 report.xlsx`).
If a path itself contains a single quote, close and reopen the quoting around it:
`'/abs/Bob'\''s deck.pptx'`.

```bash
uv run --with openpyxl python scripts/office_extract.py \
  --file '/abs/report.xlsx' \
  --anchor '{"format":"xlsx","sheet":"Sheet1","range":"A1:C10"}' \
  --out '/abs/report-q1-range.csv'
```

The output format is inferred from `--out`'s extension:

| Source | Dependency (`--with`) | Output formats |
| --- | --- | --- |
| xlsx | `openpyxl` | `xlsx`, `csv`, `md` |
| docx | `python-docx` | `docx`, `txt`, `md` |
| pdf | `pypdf` | `pdf` (page copy), `txt`, `md` |
| pptx | `python-pptx` | `txt`, `md` (slide, shape, paragraph, or table-cell text) |

xlsx extraction reads computed values (`data_only`), so formula cells yield their last
saved result. docx extraction to `docx` carries text only, not run styling.

### Patch-copy — derive an edited copy, standard library only

```bash
uv run python scripts/office_patch_copy.py \
  --file '/abs/report.xlsx' \
  --edits '{"format":"xlsx","sheet":"Sheet1","cells":{"B2":42,"C3":"hello"}}' \
  --out '/abs/report-updated.xlsx'
```

OOXML packages are ZIPs of XML parts. Patch-copy copies every part byte-for-byte and
re-serializes only the part the edits touch (one worksheet, or `word/document.xml`), so
styles, charts, images, and macros in untouched parts survive exactly. Edit shapes:

- `{"format":"xlsx","sheet":"S","cells":{"B2":42,"C3":"text","D4":true}}` — numbers,
  strings, and booleans; an existing formula in an edited cell is replaced by the value.
  Replacing a formula also drops `xl/calcChain.xml` (a recalculation cache Excel rebuilds);
  keeping a chain entry for a cell that no longer has a formula makes Excel report the
  derived file as damaged. Cells in a **shared or array formula group are refused** — the
  expression lives in one member and the others only reference it, so overwriting a member
  would strip the formula from cells you never named. Rewrite such a range with `openpyxl`.
  Coordinates outside the worksheet grid (past XFD or row 1048576) are refused too.
- `{"format":"docx","replacements":[{"paragraph":3,"text":"new text","paraId":"502E8D33","expectText":"old text"}]}` —
  the paragraph keeps its paragraph style and the first run's character style; extra run-level
  styling within that one paragraph is flattened into the new text.
  **`text` must be the complete new paragraph.** The whole body paragraph is replaced, and
  `charRange` does not narrow that — feeding back a `charRange` slice as `text` silently
  discards the rest of the sentence.
  Paragraphs carrying content this rewrite cannot preserve are **refused**, not silently
  stripped: bookmarks, comment anchors and fields pair a start with an end that may sit in
  another paragraph, so rewriting one half would unbalance the document; images, embedded
  objects, footnote/endnote references, hyperlinks and tracked changes (`w:ins`/`w:del`)
  have no place in the rebuilt run and would simply vanish — a dropped `w:del` would even
  accept a pending deletion on the user's behalf. Edit those with `python-docx`
  (`uv run --with python-docx python`), which preserves inline structure.
  `paraId` (optional) is resolved before the ordinal; a disagreement between the two is an
  error, never a silent pick. `expectText` (optional but strongly recommended) is a hard
  gate: the target paragraph's current text must match it after whitespace normalization or
  the edit is refused. **Take its value from an extract of the same paragraph taken without
  `charRange`** — the gate compares the whole paragraph, and a selection-ref `excerpt` is
  truncated at 2000 chars and may span more than the edit target.
- Any text written into a cell or paragraph must be storable in XML: control characters
  other than tab, newline and carriage return are refused. Text extracted from a deck can
  carry them (python-pptx maps a soft line break to `\x0B`), so strip them before feeding
  extracted text back in as an edit value.

Text comparisons on both sides of this skill use one normalization rule, identical
to the renderer's `normalizeSelectionText`: NFC-normalize, collapse every whitespace
run to a single space, trim the ends.

### Generate — write ad-hoc library code for new documents

Generation (a fresh deck, workbook, or document — from scratch or from data you
just extracted) has no source file to protect, so there is no fixed script: write a
short Python program against the matching library (`python-pptx`, `openpyxl`,
`python-docx`) and run it via `uv run --with <pkg> python`. The two skill
invariants still apply: write to a new file (never a path the user's original
occupies), and verify the output by reopening it before reporting success.

### Edit pptx — use python-pptx, saving to a new path

pptx edits do not go through `office_patch_copy.py`. `python-pptx` mutates the
original lxml tree in place and preserves XML it does not understand, so it is
round-trip safe (unlike `openpyxl`, which drops charts and drawings — that is why
xlsx edits use patch-copy). Open the source, apply the targeted change (locate
shapes by `shape_id` to match anchor `nodeId`), and `save()` to a NEW path:

```python
from pptx import Presentation
from pptx.enum.shapes import MSO_SHAPE_TYPE

def walk(shapes):  # extraction recurses into groups, so editing must too — a flat
    for shape in shapes:  # `for s in slide.shapes` cannot reach a grouped shape_id
        yield shape
        if shape.shape_type == MSO_SHAPE_TYPE.GROUP:
            yield from walk(shape.shapes)

p = Presentation("/abs/deck.pptx")
shape = next(s for s in walk(p.slides[1].shapes) if s.shape_id == 4)

# Write at the granularity the anchor addresses. `text_frame.text = ...` replaces the WHOLE
# shape — using it for a paragraph-level anchor deletes every other paragraph in that shape.
shape.text_frame.paragraphs[0].text = "new text"   # anchor had "paragraph": 0
# shape.table.cell(1, 0).text = "new text"         # anchor had "tableCell": {"row":1,"col":0}
# shape.text_frame.text = "new text"               # only when the anchor is the shape itself

p.save("/abs/deck-updated.pptx")  # never save over the source

# Verify at the same granularity you wrote at.
check = Presentation("/abs/deck-updated.pptx")
edited = next(s for s in walk(check.slides[1].shapes) if s.shape_id == 4)
assert edited.text_frame.paragraphs[0].text == "new text"
assert len(edited.text_frame.paragraphs) == len(shape.text_frame.paragraphs)  # nothing was dropped
```

A table shape has no `text_frame` at all — reaching for one raises `AttributeError`. Route a
`tableCell` anchor through `shape.table.cell(row, col)`.

## Output conventions

- Name derived files after the source with an operation suffix:
  `report.xlsx` → `report-updated.xlsx`, `report-q1-range.csv`, `spec-p3.txt`.
- Write into the session workspace (or where the user asked). Both scripts print the
  written path on success — report it to the user.
- `--file` and `--out` must both be absolute; a relative path is refused rather than
  resolved against whatever working directory the shell happens to be in.
- Output is staged and renamed on success, so a failed run leaves nothing behind and the
  same command can be retried at the same path.

## Verify before reporting success

Always reopen the derived file with the matching reader and check the result, e.g.:

```bash
uv run --with openpyxl python -c "
from openpyxl import load_workbook
ws = load_workbook('/abs/report-updated.xlsx', data_only=True)['Sheet1']
print(ws['B2'].value)"
```

If verification fails, say so and show the error — do not present an unverified file.

## Limits

- pptx edits go through python-pptx (see "Edit pptx"), not patch-copy; slide-copy
  into a new deck is not supported (python-pptx cannot clone slides) — say so
  when asked for it.
- Patched xlsx string cells become inline strings (valid OOXML; Excel reads them fine).
- Edited XML parts may lose insignificant serialization details (attribute quoting,
  empty-element form); namespace prefixes and untouched content are preserved.
- xlsx extraction refuses ranges over 1,000,000 cells; both scripts refuse packages
  with more than 10,000 entries, an entry over 256 MiB uncompressed, or over 1 GiB
  total uncompressed — ask the user for a smaller selection or file instead of
  retrying.
- Scanned/image-only PDFs yield no text (no OCR here).
